# Steganography

Steganography is the technique of hiding secret data within an ordinary, non-secret, file or message in order to avoid detection;
the secret data is then extracted at its destination. Here, we hide text inside image.

## Install dependencies:

``` 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Commands: 

### 1. Hiding/Encoding text in image:

### 2. Retriving message from image:
```
python steg.py -d <ENCODED IMAGE PATH>
```
<img src = 'Assets/decode.png' width=80%>
