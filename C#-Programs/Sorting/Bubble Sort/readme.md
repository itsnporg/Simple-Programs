# BubbleSort Algorithm

    BubbleSort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
    The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list.
    Bubble sort is a comparison sort, meaning that it can sort items of any type for which a “less-than” relation is defined.
    Bubble sort always takes time $O(n^2)$ where $n$ is the number of items.
